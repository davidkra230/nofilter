# nofilter
removes the minecraft: bedrock edition language filter.

*this requires admin priveleges to modify minecraft's files*

## TODO:

- [x] ask if game is installed in the default location after failing to find the filter location.
- [ ] *add more todos.*


### What it does:
* goes to the minecraft files (custom minecraft file location support planned)
* removes profanity-filter.wlist
